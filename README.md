# CDP quickstart using the Terraform Module for CDP Prerequisites

This repository contains Terraform resource files to quickly deploy Cloudera Data Platform (CDP) Public Cloud and associated pre-requisite Cloud Service Provider (CSP) resources. It uses the CDP Terraform Modules to do this.

A summary requirements, configuration and execution steps to use this repository is given below.

## Requirements

In addition to Terraform there are a number of additional requirements to discover the cross account Ids and to run the CDP environment deployment. A summary of the install steps for these requirements is given below.

> **_NOTE:_** We recommend these steps be performed within a Python virtual environment.

* Terraform can be installed by following the instructions at https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads

* Install jq as per instructions at https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/. An example for MacOS using homebrew is shown below

```bash
brew install jq
```

* Install the Python dependency packages. This includes:
  * the Ansible core and jmespath Python packages
  * cdpy, a Pythonic wrapper for Cloudera CDP CLI. Note that this in turn installs the CDP CLI.

```bash
pip install ansible-core==2.12.10 jmespath==1.0.1 

pip install git+https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cdpy@main#egg=cdpy
```

* Install the community.general and cloudera.cloud Ansible collections

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install community.general:==5.5.0

ansible-galaxy collection install git+https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cloudera.cloud.git,devel
```

* Configure cdp with CDP access key ID and private key if not already done.
  * See the [CDP documentation for steps to Generate the API access key](https://docs.cloudera.com/cdp-public-cloud/cloud/cli/topics/mc-cli-generating-an-api-access-key.html) required in the `cdp configure` command above.

```bash
cdp configure
```

* To create resources in the Cloud Provider, access credentials or service account are needed for authentication.
  * For **AWS** access keys are required to be able to create the Cloud resources via the Terraform aws provider. See the [AWS documentation for Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).
  * For **Azure**, authentication with the Azure subscription is required. There are a number of ways to do this outlined in the [Azure Terraform Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs#authenticating-to-azure).

## Configuration

The `terraform.tfvars.template` file in the required cloud provider directory contains the user-facing configuration. Edit this file to match your particular deployment.

Sample contents with indicators of values to change are shown below.

### Sample Configuration file for AWS

```yaml
# ------- Global settings -------
env_prefix = "<ENTER_VALUE>" # Required name prefix for cloud and CDP resources, e.g. cldr1

# ------- Cloud Settings -------
aws_region = "<ENTER_VALUE>" # Change this to specify Cloud Provider region, e.g. eu-west-1
aws_key_pair = "<ENTER_VALUE>" # Change this with the name of a pre-existing AWS keypair, e.g. my-keypair

# ------- CDP Environment Deployment -------
deployment_template = "<ENTER_VALUE>"  # Specify the deployment pattern below. Options are public, semi-private or private

# ------- Network Settings -------
# **NOTE: If required change the values below any additional CIDRs to add the the AWS Security Groups**
ingress_extra_cidrs_and_ports = {
 cidrs = ["<ENTER_IP_VALUE>/32", "<ENTER_IP_VALUE>/32"],
 ports = [443, 22]
}
```

### Sample Configuration file for Azure

```yaml
# ------- Global settings -------
env_prefix = "<ENTER_VALUE>" # Required name prefix for cloud and CDP resources, e.g. cldr1

# ------- Cloud Settings -------
azure_region = "<ENTER_VALUE>" # Change this to specify Cloud Provider region, e.g. westeurpoe

public_key_text = "<ENTER_VALUE> # Change this with the SSH public key text, e.g. ssh-rsa AAA....

# ------- CDP Environment Deployment -------
deployment_template = "<ENTER_VALUE>"  # Specify the deployment pattern below. Options are public, semi-private or private

# ------- Network Settings -------
# **NOTE: If required change the values below any additional CIDRs to add the the AWS Security Groups**
ingress_extra_cidrs_and_ports = {
 cidrs = ["<ENTER_IP_VALUE>/32", "<ENTER_IP_VALUE>/32"],
 ports = [443, 22]
}
```

## Execution

1. Clone this repository using the following commands:

```bash
# Git clone
git clone https://github.com/cloudera-labs/cdp-tf-quickstarts.git 
# Change to directory with the cloned repo
cd cdp-tf-quickstarts
```

2. In the cloned repo, change to required cloud provider directory and edit the variables in `terraform.tfvars` file as discussed in the section above.

```bash
# Change into cloud provider directory, e.g. for aws
cd aws

# Edit the terraform.tfvars file as needed.
```

3. To create Cloud resources and CDP environment, in the cloud provider directory, run the Terraform commands to initialize and apply the changes:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Once the deployment completes, you can create CDP Data Hubs and Data Services from the CDP Management Console (https://cdp.cloudera.com/).

### Clean up the CDP environment and infrastructure

If you no longer need the infrastructure and CDP environment thatâ€™s provisioned by Terraform, run the following command to remove the deployment infrastructure and terminate all resources.

```bash
terraform destroy
```
